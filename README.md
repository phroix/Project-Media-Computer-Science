# Project-Media-Computer-Science
As part of our study project, we had the task of developing an application for the companies Pep Digital and STEINBEISER.  Together with Kevin Erath and Martin Karl, we were able to develop initial concepts for the application and elaborate further concepts. In addition, our supervisor JÃ¶rg Nietzsche contributed further ideas to the project. We were then able to put these concepts into practice step by step.  Thus, it became clear that we would develop an application that would allow us to be a digital coffee cash register that could be used to manage employees and purchase products.  Through this project, we were able to grow beyond our limits and learn many new things. Among them, the development of an RFID reader that can be used to log in to a terminal, as well as the development with a Raspberry Pi and much more.  With this in mind, we would like to thank all those involved and wish them every success in the further development of the smart cash register.
